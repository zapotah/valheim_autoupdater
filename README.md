# Valheim autoupdater
A really naive short autoupdater script for valheim dedicated server. Run via cron as root and set permissions of the script to root:root 750 so that it cannot be modified by the server user.

This assumes the server runs as the "valheim" user, change sudo references to whatever yours runs as.
